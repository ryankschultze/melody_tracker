Mobile App for lead singer melody extraction from a mix of instruments and voices

The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application capable of automatically extracting and transcribing the predominant vocal melody line from a piece of music containing a mix of instruments. The application makes use of a Kalman-Filter in series with CNN and SVM to track the development of harmonic clusters through time, estimating which cluster represents the voice and transcribing the melody accordingly.
